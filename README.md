# Running the web-app
1. Make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `npm install`
4. Start the webserver via `node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server`

# Notes
- If step 4 didn't run a webserver then run `npm install http-server` and try again
- If you don't want to type the really long command on step 4, you could install http-server via `npm install -g http-server` then call `http-server`
